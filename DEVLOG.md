# Devlog

Session-by-session log — what was tried, what worked, what didn't, and why. See the
[README](README.md) for the current shape of the problem and the roadmap.

The first entries below happened inside
[redroid-hwenc](https://github.com/fogelmanjg/redroid-hwenc)'s own devlog, while that project was
checking whether its AMD/Intel VA-API encode work would extend to NVIDIA too. It doesn't — NVIDIA
needs its own rendering foundation first — so this history moved here, where the actual ongoing
work lives. Copied verbatim rather than summarized, so nothing about the reasoning gets lost in
translation.

## 2026-09-19 — NVIDIA: real architecture finding, plus an unrelated blocker

Set up a fresh machine from scratch for this one: Docker CE, `nvidia-container-toolkit`
(confirmed working — `docker run --gpus all ... nvidia-smi` succeeds inside a container), and
`nvidia-vaapi-driver` (Debian packages it: `nvidia-vaapi-driver 0.0.13-1`).

**Real finding, worth designing around now rather than discovering later:** unlike Mesa
(AMD/Intel), which bundles VA-API encode support automatically, `nvidia-vaapi-driver` is
**decode-only**. `vainfo` with it loaded lists plenty of decode profiles
(H.264/HEVC/VP8/VP9/AV1, all `VAEntrypointVLD`) and **zero** `VAEntrypointEncSlice` entries. The
RTX 4060 (Ada Lovelace) obviously has strong hardware encode — but it's exposed through NVENC,
NVIDIA's own proprietary API, not through VA-API. This means a future hardware Codec2 component
can't be a single VA-API backend for every vendor — it needs a vendor split: VA-API for AMD/Intel
(see redroid-hwenc), a separate NVENC-based path for NVIDIA (here).

**Unrelated blocker, not chased to a conclusion that night:** redroid itself won't boot on this
particular fresh install. `vold` and `blank_screen` — and only those two, both perfectly normal
64-bit x86-64 PIE binaries with the same `/system/bin/linker64` interpreter as everything else —
fail with `cannot execv(...): No such file or directory` moments after their process is forked,
while `hwservicemanager`/`servicemanager` start fine. Reproduces identically with `--gpus all`
removed and with `androidboot.redroid_gpu_mode=guest` (pure software rendering, no GPU
dependency at all) — so it's not GPU/NVIDIA-toolkit related. Ruled out: image corruption (layer
ID matches the source host exactly), binder device permissions (fixed a real `chmod 666` miss
along the way, different bug, didn't fix this one), storage driver (identical overlay2-on-btrfs
setup works fine on another machine), 32-bit/IA32 emulation (both binaries are 64-bit; kernel
has `CONFIG_IA32_EMULATION=y` anyway), and container-level AppArmor confinement (profile is
correctly `unconfined` for this `--privileged` container). Leading suspicion: a mount-namespace
propagation quirk specific to this fresh Debian trixie + Docker 29.8.1 + containerd 2.3.5
install, since both failing services do their own mount-namespace work at start. Not resolved —
parked separate from the (already answered) VA-API question above.

## 2026-09-19 (same day) — Hunted the boot blocker down: two missing host kernel modules, then the real NVIDIA issue

Picked this back up on a second, independent fresh host (a GTX 1050 Ti machine, also a from-
scratch Docker + nvidia-container-toolkit install) specifically to tell apart "quirk of one
machine" from "something structural." Same crash, identical `cannot execv` signature. Confirmed
this had nothing to do with Docker/containerd version either — downgraded to the exact versions
running on the machine where redroid boots fine (Docker 29.7.2, containerd 2.3.3); crash
persisted unchanged.

The real trail was earlier in `dmesg`, above where the `execv` errors show up (easy to miss if
you only grep for the visible symptom):

```
apexd-bootstrap: Failed to activate .../com.android.tzdata.apex: Could not create loop device
  for .../com.android.tzdata.apex: Failed to open loop-control: No such device
init: Service apexd-bootstrap has 'reboot_on_failure' option and failed, shutting down system.
```

`apexd-bootstrap` — the thing that mounts Android's APEX modules, itself a hard boot dependency
— was failing because **the `loop` kernel module wasn't loaded on the host.** `/dev/loop-control`
existed as a stale device node, but nothing backed it (`lsmod | grep loop` was empty), so opening
it returned ENODEV. That failure trips `apexd-bootstrap`'s `reboot_on_failure`, which makes
Android's init do its own internal soft-reboot — and it's a strictly worse state *after* that
soft-reboot that produces the `vold`/`blank_screen` `execv` errors seen in the earlier entry.
Those were downstream noise, not the cause.

`modprobe loop` got loop devices created, but the APEX *mount* still failed
(`Mounting failed for .../com.android.tzdata.apex: No such device`) — this time because
**`ext4` wasn't registered as a filesystem in the kernel either** (`cat /proc/filesystems` had
no `ext4` line at all, vs. a working host which listed it with `ext4`/`mbcache`/`jbd2` loaded).
`modprobe ext4` fixed that too.

With both modules loaded, redroid boots almost all the way: `vold`, `apexd`, `adbd`,
`gpuservice`, the graphics composer service — all come up clean. **The actual remaining failure
is now squarely an NVIDIA/Mesa incompatibility, not a host config gap:**

```
MESA: Using gralloc header from libdrm/android/gralloc_handle.h. [...] Initializing a fallback
  gralloc as a helper: Using fallback gralloc implementation
libc: Fatal signal 6 (SIGABRT) [...] in tid ... (surfaceflinger)
  #03 SkiaGLRenderEngine::chooseEglConfig
  #04 SkiaGLRenderEngine::create
```

redroid's own vendor gralloc (`gralloc.redroid.so`, built against Mesa/GBM assumptions) isn't
being used — Mesa's client library falls back to a generic gralloc implementation instead, and
SurfaceFlinger's Skia-based render engine then aborts trying to pick an EGL config against
whatever that fallback actually hands it through NVIDIA's proprietary EGL/GL stack. This crashes
`surfaceflinger` in a loop (`exited 4 times before boot completed`), which is why
`sys.boot_completed` never gets set.

**Where this leaves NVIDIA support:** it's not a missing package or a config flag this time — it's
a real vendor HAL incompatibility between redroid's Mesa-oriented gralloc/hwcomposer and NVIDIA's
driver stack. `gpuMode=guest` (pure software rendering, no GPU driver in the loop) should sidestep
this entirely and is worth confirming as a fallback; getting `gpuMode=host` genuinely working on
NVIDIA would mean either an NVIDIA-aware gralloc/hwcomposer HAL (nobody seems to have published
one for redroid) or something narrower fixing just this EGL config negotiation — not yet
investigated further.

**Worth carrying back to `redroid-manager`'s Doctor, independent of the NVIDIA question:** missing
`loop`/`ext4` kernel modules is a real, generic footgun for anyone deploying redroid on a host
that's never needed them before — cheap, high-value checks to add.

## 2026-09-19 (same day) — NVIDIA options, tried in order: guest mode works, two real sub-bugs found, core issue confirmed

Went through the cheap options before assuming a full vendor HAL rewrite is necessary.

**`gpuMode=guest` (pure software rendering) confirmed working on NVIDIA** — boots clean in ~14s,
completely sidesteps the gralloc/EGL crash since no GPU driver is involved at all. Not a real fix
(no hardware acceleration), but a legitimate practical fallback, and useful confirmation that
everything *else* (loop/ext4/binder/Codec2) is solid on this hardware — the remaining problem is
narrowly scoped to `gpuMode=host`'s graphics HAL.

**Checked whether NVIDIA's GBM/Vulkan pieces are actually reaching the container** (they need to,
for any Mesa-side fix to have a chance): confirmed complete. `nvidia-container-toolkit`'s CDI
spec (`/var/run/cdi/nvidia.yaml`) injects `libnvidia-egl-gbm.so`, `nvidia-drm_gbm.so`, the EGL
external platform configs, and the Vulkan ICD (`nvidia_icd.json`) into the container. Nothing
missing here — ruling this out as the cause narrows the problem to an actual negotiation failure,
not an incomplete environment.

**Tried forcing Zink** (Mesa's OpenGL-over-Vulkan driver, hoping to route around NVIDIA's
native EGL/GBM path entirely) via `MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=zink` / `GALLIUM_DRIVER=zink` env
vars on the container. Inconclusive as a fix — the crash signature didn't change, and log
evidence suggests these env vars don't actually get honored by the code path in play here
(Android's `platform_android` EGL backend, not a normal desktop Mesa app), so this wasn't a real
test of Zink, just a reminder that the override point needs to be found more precisely if this
route gets revisited.

**Found and fixed a real, separate bug along the way:** the crash logs (once actually read
closely, past the vold/blank_screen detour) showed `EGL-MAIN: failed to open
/dev/dri/renderD128: Permission denied` before the "fallback gralloc" messages. The device node
`--gpus all` creates inside the container is `crw-rw---- root:992` — and `surfaceflinger` runs as
Android's `system` AID, which isn't a member of that group inside the container's (Android-only)
user model. Chmod'ing the device from the *host* has no effect (nvidia-container-toolkit
recreates the node fresh inside the container, not a true bind-mount of the host's permission
bits) — fixed it with `docker exec ... chmod 666 /dev/dri/*` from inside the running container
instead.

**With that permission bug fixed, the actual root cause is confirmed, cleanly, with no more
noise in the way:** `RenderEngine: no suitable EGLConfig found, giving up`, in
`SkiaGLRenderEngine::chooseEglConfig`. Device access is no longer the problem — this is a genuine
EGL config negotiation failure between whatever Mesa's Android-platform fallback gralloc offers
and what NVIDIA's EGL implementation is willing to hand back. redroid's own vendor gralloc
(`gralloc.redroid.so`) apparently isn't even the one being used here (Mesa's log explicitly says
it's using a "fallback gralloc" instead) — so there are really two layered questions now: (1) why
does `gralloc.redroid.so` decline to handle NVIDIA in the first place, and (2) why does Mesa's
own fallback then fail to agree on an EGL config with NVIDIA specifically. Neither answered yet.

**Where this leaves it:** the cheap options are exhausted and didn't produce a fix — this really
does look like it needs actual HAL-level work, not a config/env-var nudge. `gpuMode=guest` stays
the practical fallback for NVIDIA hosts in the meantime.

## 2026-09-19 (same day) — Prior art exists, but it doesn't fit redroid's headless model

Before assuming a HAL rewrite from scratch, searched for whether anyone solved the equivalent
problem in a similar project. They have:
[**waydroid-nvidia**](https://github.com/Shiro836/waydroid-nvidia) gets full GPU-accelerated
Android-in-container on NVIDIA working — real, verified (Minecraft Bedrock, 2ms present-to-present
latency benchmarks). The approach: proxy Vulkan (Mesa Venus) from the Android guest over a unix
socket to a host-side renderer, allocate buffers host-side as NVIDIA block-linear images, and
hand them to the consumer as native NVIDIA dmabufs — no cross-vendor EGL/gralloc negotiation at
all, which is exactly the class of problem hit here.

**The catch that matters for this project:** this architecture requires a real Wayland compositor
(KWin/Plasma, verified) already running on the host — the Android container renders *through*
that existing desktop session, it isn't headless. That's a real, new constraint that doesn't exist
for AMD/Intel today, and matters for the headless-server use case this whole effort cares about.
Porting this approach as-is would mean giving up headless operation specifically on NVIDIA hosts.

Other requirements worth noting if this gets revisited: `nvidia-open`/`nvidia-open-dkms` kernel
modules specifically (not the classic proprietary blob) — not yet confirmed which one was running
on the test machines. Driver 595.71+ with `nvidia-drm.modeset=1`. Turing (RTX 20/GTX 16) or
newer GPUs — the GTX 1050 Ti used for the tests above is Pascal, older than what's verified to
work; the RTX 4060 (Ada) in this same fleet would qualify. Separately, NVIDIA's developer forums
note they don't build `nvidia-utils` against bionic libc — a known ABI friction point in this
space generally, distinct from this specific bug but the same swampy territory.

Not a drop-in fix, but the most concrete lead that exists for this specific problem today.

## 2026-09-22 — Repo split off from redroid-hwenc

redroid-hwenc reached a real, confirmed-on-two-vendors Tier 5 (AMD + Intel, VA-API hardware
encode working end to end for a real app). NVIDIA needs its own foundation first (see README) and
the technical work is unrelated to VA-API encode, so this history moved here rather than
continuing to live inside a project that's actually about something else now. Nothing new
investigated yet in this entry — the four entries above are the starting point, not new findings.
